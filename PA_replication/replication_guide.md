## Replication Guide

*Replication files:*
1. main_replication.R
2. simulation_replication.R
3. indian_vignette_replication.R

The majority of the replication code for this paper is found in main_replication.R. Code for the simulation in Section 2 (Figure 1) and the vignette experiment in Section 5 (Table 3) are stored in the two other replication scripts.

The remainder of this guide walks through each section of the main replication file, to aid reproduction of the paper's results.

*All code should be run sequentially as it appears in main_replication.R.*

### NB: Working directory

The working directory should be set to the main directory of this replication package. All code and data is accessed via relative-paths.

## 0. Prerequisites

Includes package initialisation and initial seed setting commands. The results in the code were run using the following package versions (latest releases as of 27 June 2019):

foreign_0.8-71
broom_0.5.2
ggpubr_0.2.1
stargazer_5.2.2
CBPS_0.20
scales_1.0.0
gridExtra_2.3
effects_4.1-1
plyr_1.8.4
plm_2.0-2
lmtest_0.9-37
xtable_1.8-4
FindIt_1.1.4
BayesTree_0.3-1.4
clusterSEs_2.6.1
scales_1.0.0
lme4_1.1-21
sjstats_0.17.5
dplyr_0.8.1
ltm_1.1-1
wesanderson_0.3.6
tidyverse_1.2.1

Code run using R version 3.6.0.

## 1. Functions

Functions required to execute aspects of the code:

- *consist.risk* calculates the consistency of participants risk attitudes in experiment
- *redist.fun* normalizes distribution of abilities
- *bracket* adds brackets around a vector of numbers, used in table production for reporting standard errors.
- *abilityCalc* calculates the relative ability of participants within the lying experiments
- *icc_modes* calculates the intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient for the lying experiment (report rate and RET performance)
- *icc_se* bootstraps a standard error corresponding to icc_modes ICC estimate

## 2. Necessary data cleaning

All original data files are included. This section runs the necessary data formatting and cleaning required to run the main analysis.

*All* data-management code must be run. This generates the mode-specific dataframes and the combined *pdata* dataframe used for the machine-learning procedure.

## 3. Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics data generated for the lying experiment. NB: descriptive figures and tables produced as part of the Appendix are included in section X below.

## 4. Tables

Model generation and table formatting for the three tables that appear in the main text.

**NB:**
1. The bootstrapped ICC standard error estimates are reasonably computationally-intensive. Running the total set of eight function calls will take a substantial amount of time (~15 minutes on a 2017 MacBook Pro 2.3ghz i5).
2. Table 3 is generated in the separate indian_vignette_replication.R script

## 5. Figures

Model generation and production  of figures in the main text.

**NB:**
1. Figure code should be run after the table code has been executed.
2. Figure 1 is generated in the separate simulation_replication.R script
3. BART estimation is included in this section.

## 6. Appendix tables

Code for tables in the appendix.

## 7. Appendix figures

Code for figures in the appendix.
